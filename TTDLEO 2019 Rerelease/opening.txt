Welcome my Lord!  We've got a lot of work to do!
The evil Dark Lord Morgoroth's grip on this land is growing stronger everyday!  If we're going to do something, we've got to start today!
I've taken the liberty of gathering some soldiers from the nearby villages.  We've also managedto raise a little bit of gold to help our cause.
This little bit of gold isn't much, though.  You'll have to be careful with it.
Well, you've got a lot of work ahead of you, so I'll leave you to get to that.
I'll be nearby if you need me though, my Lord.
