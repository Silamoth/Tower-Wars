Some say the wizard has lived centuries...
Lord Morgoroth came to power recently
Morgoroth has a strong Elite Guard
The people live in constant fear
Some people have joined Morgoroth
Many are still loyal to the Old King
The Old King ruled for decades
Some say other species live somewhere...
Morgoroth seeks to create an entire empire
Rumor has it Morgoroth has magical powers
The last rebellion attempt didn't end well...
It's said magical power lies toward the east
Very few people practice magic in this age
The Old King fell after a mysterious scandal
Long ago, something wiped out all civilization
The poor folk have suffered under Morgoroth
Morgoroth has banned all magical practice
The Old King was loved  by the people
